![CEC](icon.png)

The built-in functionality Kodi provides for HDMI-CEC doesn't allow you to seperately turn on/off your devices based on what content you're playing.
This add-on replaces the built-in functionality (you'll have to manually turn that one off), and provides you with a way to send your own CEC commands through cec-client.
